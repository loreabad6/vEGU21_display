### Study Area

.pull-left-35[
#### Rio Lucma Catchment

- **Location**: eastern side of the Cordillera Blanca.

- **Average rainfall** in the area: 1,169 mm/year, (80% during the rainy season i.e. November to April). 

- **Elevation difference**: 2,500 - 5,830 m a.s.l.

- **47 km** of simple unpaved roads were *recently* constructed to connect remote settlements.

- Located in a high relief landslide-prone area.

- Roads are rarely equipped with drainage or landslide mitigation measures.

### Landslides along the recently constructed roads 
- Several landslides were triggered due to road construction, which affected an approximate area of 32 ha. 

- We identified and characterised these landslides by combining field mapping, visual interpretation and semi-automated analysis of satellite imagery (PlanetScope and RapidEye-2).

### Landslide characteristics for three subset areas
- We investigated in detail three specific subsets, where we identified, delineated, and described **56 landslides**. 

- We derived quantitative (e.g., area, elevation of the headscarp and deposition, reach) and qualitative characteristics from these landslides, including their timing of concurrence with respect to road construction.

### Landslide occurrence

- We conducted a visual interpretation of satellite imagery on the [Planet Explorer online platform](https://www.planet.com/explorer/) to determine landslide occurrence and road construction dates. 

- Based on this interpretation we derived the timing of occurrence of the landslides as the number of days between road construction and landslide occurrence.

- Hence, the landslide occurrence and road construction dates in the following panels refer to the first time the landslide or the new road, respectively, was observed on VHR imagery.

- We analysed rainfall data from two stations of the [Servicio Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología del Perú (SENAMHI)](https://www.senamhi.gob.pe/).

- **75%** of landslides were observed on satellite imagery simultaneously with road construction work.

- The remaining **25%** were identified between one week and seven months after the roads had been constructed.

- **51%** of the landslides were observed during the wet season (November to April).

- **41.1%** occurred during El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) strong cool phase or “La Niña” period.

### Final remarks
We observed that the majority of mapped landslides were directly (e.g., landslides resulting from slope undercutting) or indirectly associated with road constructions (e.g., rainfall-induced landslides resulting from a combination of extreme precipitation over slopes with decreased stability) and that the road constructions also may set preconditions for subsequent rainfall-triggered landslides.
